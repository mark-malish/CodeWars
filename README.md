# CodeWars

A repository filled with the codewars challenges I've completed.

How It's Made:
Tech used: js
I complete challenges daily and upload my solution here.

Optimizations
First goal is to solve the problem. After that I refactor my code to make it more readily understandable and efficient.

Lessons Learned:
If I can quote Miley Cyrus "there's always gonna be another mountain" to climb. Only by attempting to do so, do you test your mettle. It's okay to not be able to answer a question so long as you take the initative to improve.
